# Learning Rails

## Overview

This repo is meant to be forked for your hands-on learning use.

The tasks in this repository will require the learner to be versed in Ruby.  Links to relevant readings will be provided for overviews of each topic.

Completion of these tasks will provide a brief overview of how one might approach creating the Rails framework and hopefully expose some interesting facets of Ruby to the learner.

While some tasks may be completed independently of others, other tasks will require successful completion of prior tasks.

## Topics
The following topics have exercises which may be tested by running "rake spec" in the exercise's directory.

Each exercise will have its own directory.

Hints are available in the /hints directory.
